USAR PIP:
For others who run into this situation, I found this to be the most straightforward solution:

Run , where venv_name is the name of your virtual environment.
> conda create -n venv_name 
> source activate venv_name

Run . This will install pip to your venv directory.
> conda install pip

Find your anaconda directory, and find the actual venv folder. 
It should be somewhere like /anaconda/envs/venv_name/.

Install new packages by doing
> /anaconda/envs/venv_name/bin/pip install package_name.

This should now successfully install packages using that virtual environment's pip!
